>In this project, you will develop a model for a thermal system, anduse that model to propose a design for that system. As in the first project, you’ll be using stocks and flows, and differential equations. In contrast with the first project, the quantities you will model are less tangible (e.g., internal energy), and the flow models that you will have to develop are likely to be more involved: they will involve a variety of physical principles, and also are likely to involve explicit time dependence. In addition, this project explicitly involves a “design question”.


Our project was to create a simple model of a rocket engine cooling system by approximating a partial differential equation to track the temperature of the fuel at various points in the coolant loop.
